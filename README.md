Old UI works.

#### BYTES
Includes an intro that asks for your name and remembers it, and a binary-selection interface with a toggle for more options. The splash is chosen from two random splashes. Nothing more.

#### Doorway and Doorway X
A simple utility to count lines, words, characters in given text. X is an eccentric redesign.

#### XPR
A splash with a menu of 4 choices. The title says Tritium since it was supposed to be a part of WEBv3 (Tritium). Nothing more.
