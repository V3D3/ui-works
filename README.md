#### BYTES
Includes an intro that asks for your name and remembers it, and a binary-selection interface with a toggle for more options. The splash is chosen from two random splashes. NM.

#### Doorway and Doorway X
A simple utility to count lines, words, characters in given text. X is an eccentric redesign.
